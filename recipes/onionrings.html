    <h4>Onion rings - Air Fryer Edition</h4>
    <p>
      If you are in mood for some onion rings but want to avoid adding the extra
      calories, you came to the right place. This recipe will be using 8 simple
      ingredients (9 if you want a little oil) and some other items; most
      importantly, an <strong>air fryer</strong>!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>&frac12; cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
      <li>tsp salt, divided</li>
      <li>&frac12; cup buttermilk, see tips above for making your own</li> 
      <li>3 egg </li>
      <li>1 cup</li>
      <li>panko breadcrumbs</li> 
      <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>1 large yellow sweet onion, sliced</li>
      <li>&frac12;-inch thick and separated into rings ▢Oil Spray, optional</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="ingredients">
      <li>
        You need 4 shallow bowls or deep plates. In the first one combine flour, paprika, and ½ tsp salt. In the second combine buttermilk (or milk and vinegar/lemon juice) and egg, then add ¼ cup of the flour mixture from the first bowl. In the third combine panko breadcrumbs, ½ tsp salt and olive oil with a fork, until the oil is evenly distributed. Put half of the panko in a fourth bowl so you can switch to the second part after the first got sticky.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pat dry the onion rings with paper towels to remove excessive moisture. Using a fork, dredge the onion rings in the flour mixture, drop them in the buttermilk mixture and then dredge them in the panko mixture. (TIP: Freeze the breaded onion rings for 15 minutes on a baking sheet, this helps the panko mixture to stick better.)
      </li>
      <li>Spray Air Fryer Basket with oil spray. Place onion rings in a single layer in the Air Fryer basket. You can place smaller rings inside bigger rings if necessary, just make sure there is space between them.</li>
      <li>Cook at 400°F until golden brown and crispy, about 11-15 minutes. Spray with some cooking spray after about 6 minutes. You don't need to turn the onion rings.</li>
      <li>Carefully lift out the onion rings with a cookie spatula or fork and serve.</li>
