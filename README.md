# odin-recipes

In this project, I will be making a basic recipe website. By the time this project is done,
I will have demonstrated my skills in using html. Specifically, my ability to use all the elements I have learned thus far.
In addition, I will have demonstrated my understanding of git and github; precisely, how to make good commit messages, creating atomic commits, and my using the basic git workflow.
